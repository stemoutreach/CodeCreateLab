# 3 â€“ Raspberry Pi Pico Breadboarding

## Overview  
In this lab, youâ€™ll build an interactive breadboard circuit using a Raspberry Pi Pico. Your design will include required components to start a distance-measuring system and provide visual feedback, along with optional enhancements to make it your own.

Youâ€™ll write code that activates on a button press, reads from an ultrasonic distance sensor, and displays the result in inches. Visual cues will be given through an RGB LED. Youâ€™re encouraged to explore and personalize your project using the optional components.

## Learning Objectives  
By completing this lab, you will:

- Use a button with pull-down resistor as a digital input.
- Control a standard LED and RGB LED using digital and PWM outputs.
- Measure distance using the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and convert to inches.
- Display distance using both code output and RGB LED feedback.
- Organize code using MicroPython functions and logic blocks.
- (Optional) Add enhancements using additional components.

## Hardware Requirements

### ðŸ§© Required Components  
- **Push-button** â€“ used to initiate a distance reading.  
- **Ultrasonic Distance Sensor (HC-SR04)** â€“ measure distance to nearby objects.  
- **RGB LED** â€“ provides color-based feedback tied to distance.  
  - Example: red = close, green = far, blue = medium range.

### ðŸ’¡ Optional Components (Add Your Creative Touch!)  
- **Piezo Buzzer** â€“ give audio feedback based on proximity.  
- **Single-Color LEDs with variable brightness** â€“ use PWM for effects like fading or traffic light logic.  
- **Traffic Light LED Module** â€“ simulate stoplight behavior depending on distance.  
- **LED Matrix or LED Board** â€“ display animations or bar graphs based on distance.

## Starter Code (with TODOs)

```python
# TODO: Import necessary modules

# TODO: Define pins for TRIG, ECHO, BUTTON, and RGB (use PWM for RGB)

# TODO: Define constant for SPEED_CM_PER_US

# TODO: Define set_rgb() function
# - Set frequency for each color channel
# - Convert RGB values (0â€“255) to duty cycle (0â€“65535)

# TODO: Define read_distance_inches() function
# - Trigger ultrasonic pulse
# - Measure pulse duration
# - Convert to distance in inches

# TODO: Main loop
# - If button is pressed:
#   - Read distance
#   - Print distance in inches
#   - Set RGB LED color based on range (e.g., red < 8", blue < 16", green otherwise)
# - Add optional features here (buzzer, LEDs, etc.)
```

## Challenges & Stretch Goals  

ðŸ›  **Basic Challenge**  
- Complete the required circuit and code.
- Make sure RGB color changes based on distance.

ðŸŽ¯ **Stretch Goals (Optional)**  
- Use the buzzer to beep faster as objects get closer.
- Fade LED brightness based on distance.
- Create a traffic light behavior: green (safe), yellow (caution), red (too close).
- Use an LED board to show distance as a visual meter.
- Add a second button to reset or change modes.
