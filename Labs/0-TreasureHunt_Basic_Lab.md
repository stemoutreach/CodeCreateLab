#  0 Treasure Hunt Lab (Basic)

Welcome to your first coding adventure! In this lab, you'll build a simple Treasure Hunt game using only Python basics.

## 🎯 Goal

Write a program that simulates a basic treasure hunt using:
- `print()`
- `input()`
- `if` statements
- `while` loops

## 🧰 What You Need to Know

Complete the Python Basics Guides first:
- [0 Python Basics Guide](/Guides/0-Python_Basics_Guide.md) 

## ✅ Requirements

- Ask the player to start the game.
- Let them choose a direction (e.g., north, south, east, west).
- Use conditionals to determine the result of each direction.
- Keep looping until they find the treasure.
- Use `print()` creatively to tell a story.

## 🔄 Example Output

```
Welcome to the Treasure Hunt!
Choose a direction: north, south, east, or west: north
Oops! You hit a wall. Try again.
Choose a direction: east
You fell in a pit! Game over.
...
Congratulations! You found the treasure!
```

## 🧠 Tips

- Use a loop to keep the game running.
- You can create a variable like `found_treasure = False`.
- Use `input().lower()` to make comparisons easier.

## 📝 To Do

```python
# TODO: Welcome the player
# TODO: Ask for input
# TODO: Use while loop and if/else to check their input
# TODO: Print messages and keep going until they win
```

Have fun and be creative!
