Treasure Hunt (Basic) â€” Starter
--------------------------------
Goal: Build a tiny text adventure that loops until the player finds the treasure.

You can run this file as-is to see a working baseline.
Then, improve it to meet your lab rubric and extensions.

# --- TODO ideas ---
# 1) Add an intro story or ASCII art.
# 2) Add a mini-map: start at (0,0); moving east to (1,0) is treasure.
# 3) Add hints after 3 wrong attempts.
# 4) Add 'quit' to exit early.
