# 2.5 Sense HAT Advanced Lab: Mission Dashboard 
Use **almost every sensor** on the Sense HAT to build an interactive “Mission Dashboard” that engineers can run on their Raspberry Pi.

## Scenario  
Your Pi‑powered rover is exploring a (pretend!) exoplanet. The onboard Sense HAT must:

1. **Report the environment** – temperature, humidity, and air‑pressure.  
2. **Track orientation & motion** – pitch/roll/yaw from the IMU (gyro + accelerometer).  
3. **Show heading** – magnetic compass pointing to “planet north”.  
4. **Respond to the joystick** – cycle between display modes without stopping the program.

Everything is shown on the 8 × 8 LED matrix; no extra hardware is allowed.

---

## Learning Goals
* Read real‑time data from every major Sense HAT sensor.  
* Convert raw sensor values into something meaningful (e.g., orientation arrows, compass needle).  
* Design a **state‑machine** controlled by the joystick.  
* Practice clean, well‑commented Python and graceful program shutdown.

## Requirements
| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Mode 1 — Orientation** | Display an arrow that shows which way “up” is (uses gyro/accelerometer). |
| **Mode 2 — Environment** | Scroll the current temp, humidity, and pressure across the LEDs, color‑coded: red = temp, green = humidity, blue = pressure. |
| **Mode 3 — Compass** | Draw a white dot in the center and a red “needle” pixel that rotates as the magnetometer heading changes. |
| **Joystick** | Middle‑click switches modes; any other direction resets the LED matrix to a solid color that indicates the direction pressed. |
| **Graceful Exit** | `Ctrl +C` stops the loop, clears the LED matrix, and prints a goodbye message. |

**Stretch Ideas (optional)**  
* Log all sensor data to CSV once per second.  
* Turn the whole matrix into a live bar graph of acceleration magnitude.  
* Flash the display if temperature crosses a threshold you pick.

## Hints
* The Sense HAT API returns orientation in degrees `{ "pitch": …, "roll": …, "yaw": … }`.  
* `sense.get_compass()` already gives magnetic heading in degrees (0 = north).  
* Use **joystick callbacks** (`sense.stick.direction_any = my_handler`) so your main loop stays clean.  
* Pre‑define 8×8 pixel patterns for the four arrows to keep the code tidy.
* Getting started help: [Sense HAT Advanced Lab: Mission Dashboard Template](1.5-SenseHat_Advance_Lab_Template.md)

## Deliverables
* `sensehat_mission_dashboard.py` – fully working program.  
* Short **README paragraph** at the top of the file explaining how to run it.
