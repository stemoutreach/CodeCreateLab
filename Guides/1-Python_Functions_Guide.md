# 1 Python Functions Guide

This guide will help you add functions to your Python programs.

## 🧱 What Is a Function?

A reusable block of code.

## 🧪 Example

```python
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```

## ✉️ Functions with Parameters

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello,", name)

greet("Alex")
```

## 🔁 Functions with Return

```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

result = add(2, 3)
print(result)
```

## ✅ Now Try This

Create a program with:
- A function to ask for input
- A function to print different messages based on input
- A loop that calls the functions until the correct answer is given
