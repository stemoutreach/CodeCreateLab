# Code & Create Lab — Parent & Volunteer Guide
*Version: v1.1 • Updated: 2025-10-28*

> Audience: Parents, guardians, adult volunteers, mentors  
> Summary: What the program is, how it runs, how to support students, and what to expect.


# BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)
**We help students learn by doing.** Your main job as a parent/volunteer is to **encourage persistence and thinking**, not to give answers. This guide explains how we run sessions and how you can best support learners.

---

## Program Overview
**Code & Create Lab** introduces students to **Python programming**, **Raspberry Pi / Pico**, and **hands‑on electronics** through small, confidence‑building projects.

- **Format:** Self‑paced **Guides → Labs**. Every Guide teaches 1–2 ideas; every Lab applies them.
- **Levels:** 00 (Basics) → 04 (PicoBot). Students can stop after any level and still succeed.
- **Outcomes:** Computational thinking, problem‑solving, teamwork, and creative confidence.

> Typical audience: **Grades 6–10**. Younger learners (4–5) are welcome **with an accompanying adult**.

---

## How Sessions Work
- **Self‑paced:** Students progress after demonstrating understanding and completing a Lab checklist.
- **Tiny wins:** Activities are chunked into 5–10 minute steps to build momentum.
- **Mentor loop:** Observe → Ask a thinking question → Nudge toward next step → Celebrate progress.
- **Artifacts:** Students keep code, wiring photos, and a short reflection for each Lab.

---

## Roles & Expectations
### Students
- Try first, then ask for help; explain your thinking out loud.
- Treat equipment and teammates with care.
- Save work, commit often if using GitHub (optional).

### Parents / Guardians
- Encourage **patience** and **safe practices** (no rushing with wiring/tools).
- Let students drive the keyboard/mouse—**coaching beats doing**.
- Flag safety or behavior concerns to mentors, not other students.

### Volunteers / Mentors
- Model curiosity and kindness; use **questions over answers**.
- Keep interactions learner‑centered and inclusive (see Playbook below).
- Follow safety guidelines and report incidents to the lead immediately.

## Mentor Playbook (Do / Don’t)
**Do**
- Ask: “What have you tried? What could you try next?”  
- Break problems down: “Let’s check the LED wiring first, then the code.”  
- Normalize struggle: “Errors are clues; let’s read them together.”  
- Use pair‑programming prompts: Navigator asks, Driver types.

**Don’t**
- Grab the keyboard or rewire without narrating and handing control back.  
- Over‑explain. If you’ve talked for 60 seconds, ask a question.  
- Share personal contact info with students or meet 1:1. Keep communication in program channels.

---

## Safety & Well‑Being
- **Hardware:** Use resistors with LEDs; keep hands away from moving wheels; lift robots before testing turns.
- **Environment:** Keep backpacks off walkways; drinks stay away from electronics.
- **People:** Be respectful; no harassment or exclusion. If something feels off, tell the lead **immediately**.
- **Two‑adult rule:** Avoid 1:1 situations. Interact within visible, program spaces.

---

## Equipment & Materials
- We provide shared kits when possible; bring‑your‑own is welcome at your own risk.  
- Label personal gear. The program is not responsible for loss/damage.  
- If a part fails, alert a mentor—don’t “force it.”

---

## Communication
- Primary channel: **On‑site announcements** and posted **Guide/Lab handouts**.  
- Optional: Program email/newsletter for schedule changes and resources.  
- For questions, use the group help queue (sticky note, whiteboard list, or chat—depending on venue).

---

## Behavior & Escalation
- First reminder is private and kind.  
- Second reminder includes a reset (short break or move seats).  
- Third step: Lead mentor contacts parent/guardian and pauses participation for the day.

---

## Inclusion & Accessibility
- We welcome learners of all backgrounds and experience levels.  
- We can adjust pace, pairing, or materials—**tell us what helps your student**.  
- Quiet space available on request; noise‑sensitive alternatives (e.g., visual instead of audio cues).

---

## How to Volunteer
- Sign up for a session shift; arrive 10–15 minutes early for the **daily brief**.
- Read the **Guide/Lab** you’ll support; try the starter code if time allows.
- Wear a name tag and introduce yourself to your table.
- Debrief: Share wins and improvement ideas at wrap‑up.

## FAQs
**Do students need prior experience?**  
No. Level 00 assumes none. We build up gradually.

**Can students work in teams?**  
Yes—pairs are encouraged for debugging and design.

**Can younger students join?**  
Yes, **grades 4–5** with a responsible adult who stays and supports them.

**Can we bring our own Raspberry Pi/Pico?**  
Yes. Label everything. We’ll try to help, but we can’t guarantee compatibility with all setups.
