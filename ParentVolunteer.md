# CodeCreateLab – Parent & Volunteer

Welcome to **CodeCreateLab!**  
Our mission is to introduce students to the world of **Raspberry Pi** and **Python programming** through hands-on exploration, creativity, and problem-solving.

This program is geared for **6th through 10th grade students**.  
Younger students, 4th and 5th grade, are welcome but must be accompanied by an adult who can help them work through the levels.  
Students are also encouraged to bring their own **Raspberry Pi** projects to get help and guidance from mentors.

## 🎯 Program Goals

- Teach foundational computing and coding skills using real hardware and real code.  
- Build confidence and independence by helping students *learn how to learn*—not just follow instructions.  
- Encourage curiosity through open-ended challenges where students are empowered to experiment, explore, and debug on their own.

---

## 🧭 How It Works

- The program is **self-paced**, allowing students to move forward as they master each skill level.  
- Each level introduces new concepts and builds on the last—growing in complexity as students grow in capability.  
- **Progress is earned**, not given. Students must **demonstrate understanding** and complete all challenges in a level before advancing to the next.  
- Students are encouraged to go as far as they want. Whether they complete one level or many, we celebrate their effort and growth.

## 🔍 What We’re Looking For

We’re not just teaching code—we’re developing **thinkers, tinkerers, and problem-solvers**.  
We’re especially excited to support students who:

- Show a **genuine interest in learning**  
- Take **initiative**  
- Push through **challenges**  
- Want to understand *how and why*, not just *what to do*

## 🙌 How You Can Help

As a parent or volunteer, your role is to:

- **Encourage perseverance**, not perfection  
- **Celebrate progress**, not just outcomes  
- **Support self-discovery**, even when it means letting students struggle a little to solve problems  

This program isn’t about quick wins—it’s about **building a mindset that will serve students in every area of life**.

Thank you for being part of the journey!
