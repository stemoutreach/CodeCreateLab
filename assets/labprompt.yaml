# Code & Create Lab — Lab Authoring Prompt
# Save this file as labprompt.yaml and reference it whenever generating a new lab.

role: >
  You are helping me write a NEW, student-friendly Lab for my Code & Create Lab.

mission: >
  Produce a single Markdown file that strictly follows the Lab Template. The Lab must
  reinforce the corresponding Guide and include open-ended moments so students can reason,
  test, and tune—not just copy/paste.

audience: "6th–12th graders; curious, hands-on; short attention spans."
tone: "Clear, encouraging, stepwise; minimal jargon unless taught in the Guide."

constraints:
  - "Keep section order exactly as in the template."

  - "Perform a full sweep after drafting: ensure all required sections are present and in the exact order."
  - "Step 4 (Decide What Happens): use a checklist + brief pseudocode only — NO concrete solution code."
  - "Include exactly one 'Skeleton Starter' section (no duplicates)."
  - "Insert a '🆘 Need a hint?' callout directly under '# Steps' linking to 'Example_Code/00-treasure-hunt-basic/STUDENT_START.md'."
  - "Do NOT include full solution code anywhere in the lab; only reference the helper ('STUDENT_START.md')."
  - "Include a short rubric with Must and a Stretch item (1–3 bullets each)."
  - "Use Plan → Build → Code → Test → Iterate cadence."
  - "Provide a minimal Starter snippet (or starter file list) that is helpful, not a full solution."
  - "Add Troubleshooting with practical failure modes and fixes."
  - "Add Reflection questions that push students to explain choices/tuning."
  - "End with a Next up pointer to the logical next lab or guide."
  - "Prefer small, testable functions and safe exits (Ctrl-C) for hardware."
  - "If hardware is involved, include Safety & setup and explicit pin maps."
  - "Never require installing software on school laptops unless stated."

ties_to_guide:
  required: true
  guidance: >
    Add one or two short Guide tie-ins (callouts) that tell students where to look
    in the Guide when they get stuck (section names or topics provided), and design at
    least one step where the Guide is needed to proceed.

  - "Lab Title: <Lab Title>"

  # Goal
  One concise paragraph that states the outcome in student terms (what the thing
  will do) and how they’ll prove it works.

  ## Materials
  - <hardware/software list, keep short>

  ## Safety & setup
  - <only if hardware; power, wiring, safe stopping, shared grounds, etc.>

  ## Steps
  1) **Plan** — <students make one or two small design choices (e.g., thresholds, pin choices, map)>
  2) **Build** — <wire/place/organize; encourage sketching or checklists>
  3) **Code** — <starter guidance; name small functions; avoid giving the full solution>
  4) **Test** — <what to observe; small tuning knobs; quick sanity checks>
  5) **Iterate** — <one improvement loop (e.g., tune a constant, refactor a function)>

  > 💡 **Guide tie-in:** <Callout that points to a specific topic/section in the Target Guide students should read to unlock this step.>

  ## Starter snippet (or starter files)
  ```python
  # keep small; demonstrate structure, I/O, or a key helper function
  ```

  ## Submission / Demo checklist
  - [ ] <outcome 1 stated in behavior terms students can demo>
  - [ ] <outcome 2>
  - [ ] <clean exit or safe stop>

  ## Extensions (choose one)
  - <extension idea that uses knowledge from the Guide and invites creativity>
  - <second idea (optional)>

  ## Troubleshooting
  - **Symptom** → <likely cause> → <student-doable fix>
  - **Symptom** → <likely cause> → <student-doable fix>

  ## Reflection
  2–3 prompts that ask *why* they chose/tuned something, or how they’d modularize further.

  ## Next up
  A single sentence that points to the next Lab/Guide and why it’s a good next step.

  ## Next up
  <where to go next and why>

post_generation_checklist:
  - "Structure: All required sections exist and follow the exact template order."
  - "Discovery: Step 4 uses a checklist + brief pseudocode (no concrete solution code)."
  - "Starters: Exactly one 'Skeleton Starter' section is present (no duplicates)."
  - "Hints: Insert the '🆘 Need a hint?' callout directly under '# Steps' linking to 'Example_Code/00-treasure-hunt-basic/STUDENT_START.md'."
  - "No spoilers: No full solution code anywhere in the lab; only reference the helper ('STUDENT_START.md')."
  - "Links: Validate Guide links and helper paths are correct and relative."
  - "Code fences & headings: Fences close correctly; no duplicate headers; consistent h2 '## 1)…' step numbering."
  - "Student agency: Leave at least 2 clear TODOs for learners to implement."
