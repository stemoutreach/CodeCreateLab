You are helping me write a NEW student-friendly technical Guide for my Code & Create Lab.
Follow this EXACT structure and voice. Keep explanations clear and practical. Use the same
section order and formatting shown below. Use Python for examples unless otherwise stated.

=====================================
TEMPLATE & STYLE (DO NOT ALTER ORDER)
=====================================

# <Guide Title>

> ### Quick Summary
> **Level:** <two-digit level> • **Time:** <range>  
> **Prereqs:** <None OR links to earlier Guides>  
> **Hardware:** <if any>  
> **You’ll practice:** <short, comma-separated skills list>

# Why This Matters
One short paragraph that motivates the topic with concrete payoffs for the next lab or future guides.
(Keep it learner-focused and actionable.)

---
## What you’ll learn
- 5–8 crisp bullets of learning outcomes (verbs + object).
- Prefer specific skills over vague concepts.

## Setup
_Optional first line for environment context (e.g., “This setup uses MicroPython with Thonny.”)_
- List software/runtime setup (or say “Any Python 3 environment”).
- Link to starter code folder if relevant (Example_Code/<folder>/).
- For hardware: include a short sanity-test snippet (e.g., Sense HAT “Hello!”).

## Materials  (ONLY include if hardware is involved)
- Bullet list of parts with brief clarifications (values, safety notes).

---
## Walkthrough — Step by Step (with explanations)

### 1) <Step title>
**Idea:** One-sentence “what & why”.
Provide small code snippets and a short “Anatomy/Breaking it down” bullet list.
Include **Common mistakes** or **Notes & pitfalls** when useful.

### 2) <Step title>
**Idea:** …
(code)
**Notes & pitfalls:** short bullets of gotchas or safety rules.

### 3) <Step title>
…continue until the learner can complete the Try-it project.

(When relevant for hardware: include brief diagrams/ASCII, pin maps, safety/voltage notes.)

---
## Vocabulary
- Term: short, student-friendly definition (5–10 items max)

---
## Check your understanding
1) 4–6 short questions that test the essentials they just learned.

---
## Try it: Mini-exercises
Describe a small task they can complete in 10–20 minutes.
Add 1–2 **Stretch goals**.

---
## Troubleshooting
- Bullet common errors and their fixes (error message → remedy).

---
## Next up
Point to the matching **Lab** file using this format:
**[<level> – <Lab name>](../Labs/<level>-<lab-file>.md)**

========================
TONE & MICRO-GUIDELINES
========================
- Keep sections concise; prioritize runnable examples and short “Idea” blurbs.
- Use numbered steps in Walkthrough. Each step: tiny code + explanation + pitfalls.
- Prefer small runnable code blocks (no giant monoliths).
- Use 4 spaces for indentation; don’t mix tabs/spaces.
- When reading input or hardware pins, show “why it works” and common mistakes.
- For hardware, call out 3.3V/5V, series resistors, and safe wiring explicitly.
- Keep vocabulary & checks tight; avoid jargon unless defined.
