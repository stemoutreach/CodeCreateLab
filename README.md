# Code & Create Lab

**Learn by building.** Code & Create Lab is a self‑paced quest that walks students—from absolute beginners to budding roboticists—through the fundamentals of **Python programming**, **physical computing**, and **autonomous navigation**.

Each **Lab** is a milestone project. Each **Guide** teaches the skills needed to complete that project. By the final level, you’ll have a mecanum‑wheel robot that recognises AprilTags and drives itself around a course.

## 🎯 Purpose

1. **Make STEM approachable** – lower the entry barrier so anyone (Grades 4–10 +) can start creating with code and electronics.  
2. **Turn theory into practice** – every concept is immediately applied in a real, working artefact.  
3. **Promote a growth mindset** – short wins build confidence; stretch goals reward curiosity.  
4. **Empower instructors & mentors** – modular guides, checklists, and wiring diagrams shorten prep time.
